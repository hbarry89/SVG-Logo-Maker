<img src="./demo-images/demo1.png" width="600" height="100">

---------------------------

- Then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` in the exmaples folder:

<img src="./demo-images/demo2.png" width="400" height="100">

---------------------------

- When you open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, you are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria you entered:

<img src="./demo-images/demo3.png" width="350" height="200">

---------------------------
