## Description

- The purpose of this repository is for web developers to generate a simple logo for their projects.

## Usage

- [Click here](*) for a video demo of this application.
- [Click here](https://github.com/hbarry89/SVG-Logo-Maker/blob/main/examples/logo.svg) to see a sample SVG logo.

---------------------------

- You will be presented with a series of questions:

<img src="./demo-images/demo1.png" width="600" height="60">

---------------------------

- With a list of the shapes:

<img src="./demo-images/demo2.png" width="600" height="80">

---------------------------

- After answering the questions, your answers will be captured AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line:

<img src="./demo-images/demo3.png" width="200" height="100">

---------------------------

- Then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` in the exmaples folder:

<img src="./demo-images/demo4.png" width="200" height="100">

---------------------------

- When you open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, you are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria you entered:

<img src="./demo-images/demo5.png" width="300" height="200">
